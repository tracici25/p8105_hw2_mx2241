## Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx" ,
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

Read precipitation data for 2018 and 2017

``` r
precip_2018 = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation.

``` r
month_df =
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017) 

left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 x 4
    ##     year month total month_name
    ##    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     
    ##  1  2018     1  0.94 January   
    ##  2  2018     2  4.8  February  
    ##  3  2018     3  2.69 March     
    ##  4  2018     4  4.69 April     
    ##  5  2018     5  9.27 May       
    ##  6  2018     6  4.77 June      
    ##  7  2018     7 10.2  July      
    ##  8  2018     8  6.45 August    
    ##  9  2018     9 10.5  September 
    ## 10  2018    10  2.12 October   
    ## # … with 14 more rows

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trashwheel collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset
contains information on year, month, and trash collected, include some
specific kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in our final
dataset. Additional data sheets include month precipitation data.

## Problem 2

Import and Clean NYC Transit Dataset

``` r
transit_df = 
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% #select the variables of interest
  mutate(
    entry = recode(entry, 'YES' = TRUE, 'NO' = FALSE),
    ) #change entry class from character to logical#clean names for column titles
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

The dataset contains variables for line, station name, station latitude
/ longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance type, and ADA
compliance. After importing the dataset by `read_csv`, its variable
names were cleaned by `janitor::clean_names`. Then, I selected the
variables of interest by using `select`. Also, `recode` were used to
switch the entry variable from character to logical. In the resulting
dataset, there are 1868 rows and 19 columns. So far, the dataset is not
tidy because the route variables are spreading across 11 columns.

`distinct` function was used to calculate the number of distinct
stations. It was found that there are 465 distinct stations. Out of
these station, there are 84 stations that are ADA compliant. The
proportion of station entrances/exits without vending allow entrance is
37.704918%.

Reformat the dataset further more

``` r
transit_tidy = transit_df %>% 
  mutate_at(
    vars(route8:route11),
    as.character
    ) %>% #change class from double to character
  
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_prefix = "route",
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route_name"
    ) %>% #reformat route number and route name so that they are distinct variables
  relocate(route_num, route_name) %>% # place column route_num, and route_name to the front
  arrange(route_num)
```

There are 60 distinct stations that serve the A train. Of the stations
that serve the A train, 17 are ADA compliant.

## Problem 3
